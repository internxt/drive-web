# Project Manteinance

We aim to have:

- An 'A' score on Maintainability Rating
- An 'A' score on Security Rating
- A 3% of duplicated lines

# Getting Started

## Installation

- Create a `.npmrc` file from the `.npmrc.template` example provided in the repo.
- Replace `TOKEN` with your own [Github Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with `read:packages` permission **ONLY**
- Use `yarn` to install project dependencies.

## Scripts

### `yarn start` / `yarn run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn run lint` (`yarn run lint:ts` && `yarn run lint:scss`)

- Runs .ts linter
- Runs .scss linter

### `yarn test` (`yarn test:unit`)

- Runs unit tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

### `test:playwright` (`yarn playwright test`)

- Runs end to end tests with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/)

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.

The [/src](./src) folder contains the source code.

The subfolder [/src/app](./src/app) organizes the code in a very similar way to Angular, grouping by feature related files in modules.

# New Project Structure

This project is organized following a **visual and functional hierarchy** approach. Each view (or page) has its own folder containing its specific components, styles, and logic. Additionally, reusable components, custom hooks, utilities, and global styles are stored in separate directories to enhance reusability and maintainability.

Example:

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/           # Common reusable components across the application
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Button.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Modal.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Loader.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ views/                # Main application views
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Login/            # Login view and its internal components
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LoginForm.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SocialLoginButtons.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Login.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Signup/           # Signup view and its internal components
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SignupForm.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ TermsCheckbox.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Signup.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Home/             # Home view with its main components
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Topbar.tsx    # Top navigation bar
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Sidenav.tsx   # Side navigation menu
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Dashboard.tsx # Main panel of the Home view
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Settings/     # Settings (subfolder within Home)
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ SettingsModal.tsx       # Main settings page
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ LanguageOptions.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ThemeSwitcher.tsx
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles.css
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css    # General styles for Home
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Home.tsx      # Main component for the Home view
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ NotFound/         # 404 or nonexistent route view
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ NotFound.tsx
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ styles.css

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ useTheme.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useFetch.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ services/             # Logic for interacting with external APIs or services
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ authService.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ userService.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/                # Utility functions and helpers
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ formatDate.ts     # Date formatting functions
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ validateForm.ts   # Form validation helpers
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/               # Global styles
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ variables.scss
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ global.css
â”œâ”€â”€ types/                # Global and component-specific types
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ global.d.ts       # Global types (e.g., user, environment)
â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx               # Main application entry point
â””â”€â”€ index.ts
```

## **Folder Descriptions**

### **`components/`**

This folder contains common and reusable components that are used across different views, such as buttons, modals, or loaders. These are atomic components and are not tied to any specific view.

---

### **`views/`**

Each main application view has its own folder (e.g., `Login`, `Signup`, `Home`). Inside each folder:

- Specific components related to the view are included at the same level.
- Local styles are kept in a dedicated CSS file.
- If a view contains complex subsections (e.g., `Settings` within `Home`), they are organized in subfolders.

---

### **`hooks/`**

Custom React hooks that encapsulate reusable logic.

---

### **`services/`**

This folder contains logic for interacting with external APIs or services. It provides an abstraction layer for API calls or other external integrations.

---

### **`utils/`**

Utility functions, global constants, and helpers that are not tied to React. These utilities can be used across the entire application.

---

### **`styles/`**

Global styles and variables for consistent theming across the application.

---

### **`types/`**

This folder contains shared TypeScript types used throughout the project

This structure ensures **modularity**, **scalability**, and **maintainability** while making the codebase easy to navigate and extend. ðŸš€

## Config Tailwind CSS purge option

It is important to add in the tailwind.config.js file, within the purge property, the list of classes that we are overriding within a Tailwind layer (components, utilities or base) for third-party packages (such as react-bootstrap)

For example, with this snippet we are telling to purge that we are overriding the react-bootstrap Dropdown and Tabs classes:

```javascript
  purge: {
    content: ["./src/**/*.tsx"],
    options: {
      safelist: [
        'dropdown-menu', 'dropdown-item',
        'nav-item', 'nav-link', 'tab-content', 'tab-pane'
      ]
    }
  }
```

## Recommended IDE extensions (Visual Studio Code)

To speed up the development and maintenance of the project, it is recommended to use the following extensions for the IDE:

- Better Comments
- ESLint
- stylelint
- PostCSS Language Support
- SCSS Formatter
- Tailwind CSS IntelliSense
